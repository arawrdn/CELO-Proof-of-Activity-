Celo Proof Of Activity NFT (PoA) is an experimental collection of abstract, on-chain generated ERC-721 tokens deployed on Celo Network. Unlike traditional PFP NFTs, Celo PoA NFTs serve as a digital certificate that recognizes and rewards a user's long-term engagement and volume of activity within the Celo ecosystem over an estimated 365-day period.
